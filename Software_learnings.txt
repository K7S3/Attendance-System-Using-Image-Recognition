Software Engineering  Learnings:
* Programming Language : Python


1. Object oriented( allows, abstraction, Inheritance, Encapsulation).
2. Having various modules to implement High level functionalities. 
3. easy to code.
4. easy to understand.


* Methodology Used :- Agile
Agile methodology helps improve quality of the product by breaking down the project into manageable units and the project team can focus on high-quality development, testing, and collaboration. This methodology helped us to improve the quality of the product by finding and fixing defects quickly and identifying expectation mismatches early
* SOLID Principles:
S — Single responsibility principle : 
In programming, this states that every module or class should have responsibility over a single part of the functionality provided by the software.
Example from the Project :- Get_face_vector, which is the module only devoted to one task which is getting face vector for the server to recognize the faces, there is no other work being done.
O  —  Open/closed principle :
        
        


* Properties of the final Project :- 
1. The project possesses modularity. It is divided into multiple classes and methods.
2. It is flexible towards expansion
3. The project is scalable


* Applied Distribution System : - Ap System
